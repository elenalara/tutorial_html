Your mission is to design a captivating webpage that not only tantalizes taste buds but also inspires wanderlust through immersive storytelling and visually stunning presentations of recipes from around the world.

## Instructions
Follow the instructions below to create the webpage step by step:
1. **Set Up the Basic Structure**
- Start by creating a new HTML file and name it index.html.
- Begin your HTML document with the DOCTYPE declaration to specify the HTML version you'll be using – HTML5.
- Then, enclose the entire content of your webpage within the `<html>` tags.
- Specify the language of the webpage as English.
2. **Head Section**
- Create the `<head>` section of your HTML document. Inside the `<head>` section, set the title of your page to "Taste of Travel" using the `<title>` tag.
- Add meta descriptions for your page using `<meta>` tags. Include the following:
    - Name: Set the name attribute to "description".
    - Content: Set the content attribute to the following description of the webpage: "Embark on a culinary adventure with Taste of Travel, exploring global flavors and recipes."
- Set the character encoding for your webpage to UTF-8 using the `<meta>` tag. This ensures proper display of special characters.
3. **Body Section: Headings and Text Formatting**
- Create the `<body>` section of your HTML document.
- Heading and Text Formatting:
    - Craft engaging headings that transport visitors to exotic destinations and entice them to discover new flavors. Specifically, create headings using `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` tags, with titles such as "Discover the Flavors of Thailand" (for `<h1>`), "Tom Yum Goong: A Spicy Thai Delight" (for `<h2>`), and "Ingredients:", "Preparation:", and "Cooking Tips:" (for `<h3>`).
    - Write a paragraph (`<p>`) describing Tom Yum Goong, emphasizing its bold flavors and aromatic spices: "Tom Yum Goong is a classic Thai soup renowned for its bold flavors and aromatic spices. This hot and sour soup features a tantalizing blend of lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves, combined with succulent shrimp."
    - Insert a `<blockquote>` element containing a quote from Chef Somchai, a Thai cuisine expert, about the essence of Tom Yum Goong: "The key to a delicious Tom Yum Goong lies in the balance of flavors – sweet, sour, salty, and spicy."
    - Below the "Ingredients:" heading, create an unordered list with list items detailing the ingredients required for Tom Yum Goong. Include "Lemongrass: 2 stalks", "Thai basil: 1 cup", "Kaffir Lime Leaves: 3 leaves", and "Shrimp: 500g". Use `<strong>` to highlight the names of the ingredients.
    - Below the "Preparation:" heading, create an ordered list with list items detailing the steps for preparing Tom Yum Goong. Include:
        1. "Simmer the broth for 10 minutes."
        2. "Add lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime leaves."
        3. "Stir in shrimp and cook until pink."
        4. "Season with fish sauce, lime juice, and chili paste."
        5. "Garnish with Thai basil and serve hot."
    - Use `<em>` to add emphasis to the words "Simmer", "Stir", "cook", "Season", and "Garnish".
    - Below the "Cooking Tips:" heading, create an unordered list with list items showcasing the following cooking tips:
        - "1/4 cup of fish sauce adds authentic Thai flavor."
        - "1 tablespoon of chili paste gives the soup its signature heat."
    - Use `<sup>` to denote serving sizes for spicy dishes and `<sub>` to indicate measurement units like teaspoons
4. **Body Section: Image and Table**
- Insert an image with the source set to "/resources/media/thai-soup.jpg" and an alt attribute describing the image as "Tom Yum Goong".
- Add two line breaks to create space between the image and the rest of the content.
- Incorporate an HTML table with a caption stating "Recipe Details". Inside the table, include rows and columns to display ingredient names and quantities:
    - Create the first row, and within it, create table headers for "Ingredient" and "Quantity". These headers should appear at the top of their respective columns.
    - Add the second row, and within it, specify the content of the first cell, which should contain the ingredient "Lemongrass", and specify the content of the second cell, which should contain the quantity "2 stalks". Repeat this step for each ingredient along with its quantity, creating a new row for each ingredient-quantity pair.
    - After listing all the ingredients, create a new row with the colspan attribute set to "2". This will create a cell that spans across both columns. Inside this cell, add the text "**Preparation Time**: 20 minutes". Repeat this step for the following text: "**Serving Suggestions**: Serve with steamed rice or jasmine tea."
5. **Review and Test**
- Review your webpage to ensure all elements are properly structured and displayed.
- Experiment and Customize – Feel free to experiment by adding additional information or elements to enhance the webpage if you wish.
